Advent of Code 2022
Rust solutions

-- Conclusions --
Using Rust this year was very fun.
It might also be because I've grown a lot since last time, but this year it felt a lot 
easier to reason about the harder problems, developing abstractions and solving them
step by step.

Some problems required a lot more lines of code when compared to Haskell, but
honestly felt very fast to write and also required comparably little debugging.
(mostly just figuring out how to rotate a cube ;) - that was a hard one)

All solutions were very fast (even dumb ones felt faster than theu should),
and after optimizations, I think every solution runs faster than 100ms.
(and without silly tricks like Haskell mutable arrays and Python numba compilation)

Overall, very happy with Rust, and considering you really can build anything with it,
It will remain my go-to for personal project
